    non-discriminatorily, and provided that the Source Code is free of
    Malicious Code.

    The L2Loot is not Malicious Code. You expressly and knowingly
    acknowledge that the L2Loot is not certified as noninfringing in
    all jurisdictions, and that the L2Loot has not been tested in all

    to USD $1000 per annum. Payments must be sent in each of the three (3)
    calendar years that follow the calendar year in which you first use
    the L2Loot in production. You must send payments no later than thirty
    (30) days after the end of the calendar year.

5.  **Change License**
    The Change License is the Apache License 2.0.
    This L2Loot will change to the Change License three (3) years after

6.  **Licensor Liability**
    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the L2Loot is
    provided by the Licensor on an "AS IS" basis, without warranty of any
    kind, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. The Licensor HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS all
    implied warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, and/or

    patent defects; (b) use of the L2Loot may result in unexpected
    results, data loss and/or communications failures; (c) the L2Loot
    includes no protection against viruses and other harmful code; and
    (d) you are solely responsible for recovery of any data lost while
    using the L2Loot.

    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE
    FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY
    OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS,
    DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (i)
    YOUR USE OF THE L2LOOT; (ii) YOUR INABILITY TO USE THE L2LOOT;
    (iii) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES; AND
    (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR
    DATA, WHETHER OR NOT LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
    certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for
    certain damages. Accordingly, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing
    disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations shall apply to the maximum
    extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails its
    fundamental purpose.
