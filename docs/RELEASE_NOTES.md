## L2Loot v1.0.0 â€” First Release (2025-10-11)

### Highlights
- **Profit search by level range**: Find the most profitable mobs to spoil in your current level range; results are **automatically ordered from most to least profitable**.
- **Chronicles support**: Search available for **C5** and **Interlude**.
- **Rift mobs control**: **Opt in/out** rift mobs and **filter by health multiplier** to match your target difficulty.
- **Flexible pricing**:
  - Set **your own item prices** to reflect your server economy.
  - Or use prices provided by **AYNIX** (owner of Discord server "Market Owners"). These prices are **applicable only for Reborn Signature Server**.
- **Simple Windows install**: MSI installer with desktop menu shortcut.

### Data sources and accuracy
- Data used in this application originates from the open-source L2J Data Pack. I also tried to align as many mobs and details as possible with [lineage2wiki.org](https://lineage2wiki.org/), but there may still be inconsistencies or errors. If you notice anything wrong or odd, please report it via GitHub Issues (this repository) or email at l2lootapp@gmail.com. Bug reports and improvement suggestions are welcome too.
